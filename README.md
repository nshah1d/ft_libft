# 42 ABU DHABI: FT_LIBFT

[Personal website which contains my current and past projects being undertaken at 42 Abu Dhabi.](https://42.nauman.cc/)
<br /><br/>
Get geared up for some coding adventure with ft_libft! This is where the rubber meets the road in future 42 projects. Picture crafting a stellar library of functions using C â€“ but these aren't your run-of-the-mill functions. They're turbocharged, designed to give the standard ones a real run for their money!
<br/><br/>
But before you dive in, here's a word of caution. This journey is through uncharted territory. This is my experimental zone, where updates are the name of the game. Keep your eyes open and your wits about you, for what's here today might be different tomorrow. This isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. It's tailored to my ongoing projects, and it's not ready for general use.
